Here is some JSON text: 
<json_text>
{{raw_text}}
</json_text>

Your task is to convert this JSON into an HTML table format.

First, carefully examine the structure and contents of the JSON text. Think through how you would convert it into an HTML table format. Consider things like:
- What keys in the JSON should become the table headers? 
- How will you handle nested objects or arrays in the JSON?
- How can you make sure the HTML table is valid and displays correctly?

After you've analyzed the JSON structure, go ahead and convert the JSON text into an HTML table. Output the full HTML table code inside <html_table> tags. 

Make sure to include all the necessary table elements like <table>, <thead>, <tbody>, <tr>, <th>, <td> etc. If the JSON contains nested objects, you may need to use multiple tables or special formatting to represent them clearly. You can add inline css for table elements for better look and feel.

Remember, the goal is to convert the JSON into a readable, properly-formatted HTML table that conveys all the original information. The resulting HTML table should be able to stand alone and make sense to someone viewing it.

Provide only the HTML table code as your response, without any additional notes or explanations.
